# TerraformBestPracticesImplementation updated
This repo is a demonstration of the best practices described in Bernd Nordhausen's "Terraform for Google Cloud Essential Guide" book.

In chapter 1 page 17 he defines a basic directory as having the following files:
    main.tf
    outputs.tf
    provider.tf
    startup.sh
    terraform.tfvars
    variables.tf
